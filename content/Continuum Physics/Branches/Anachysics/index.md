## Overview
---
Anachysics is the formal study of the structures, interactions, and governing principles of **[[Soul|souls]]** and **[[Source|Sources]]** within the **[[Continuum Physics#The Continuum|Continnuum]]**. It focuses on the behavior of the **[[Soul#The Anima Field|anima field]]**, its coherence, and its coupling with the **[[Mana#The Mana Field|mana field]]** through trans-phase resonance.

Anachysics specializes in the dynamics of living coherence, namely the feedback processes that sustain the self and permit interaction between thought and metaphysical energy. It connects the informational domain of animaspace with the energetic **[[Domain|domain]]** of manaspace, forming the theoretical foundation for life, consciousness, and transcendence within the Continuum.

The Laws of Anachysics describe how Continuum invariants manifest in the coupling between anima and mana. They define the limits of stability and evolution of coherent beings, such as how souls maintain identity, how Sources mediate energy across phase boundaries, and how both may fail and adapt.

In essence, anachysics is the physics of existence through awareness and the study of how the Continuum sustains selfhood as a stable field phenomenon.
## The Laws of Anachysics
---
### I. Law of Trans-Phase Coherence
##### Statement:
> Stable consciousness requires continuous phase lock between the anima and mana fields. A Source remains stable only while this trans-phase coupling persists.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle A, M \rangle=0\implies \text{stable Source}
$$
where:
- $A$ — anima field
- $M$ — mana field
- $\langle A, M \rangle$ — resonance overlap
##### Description:
The Law of Trans-Phase Coherence defines the fundamental stability condition for a Source. Continuous phase alignment between the anima and mana fields sustains the resonance loop that enables consciousness and willful mana control.

If coherence between these fields decays, the coupling collapses, resulting in Source instability or disjunction.
### II. Law of Soul Feedback Stability
##### Statement:
> The resonance loop coupling the anima field, Source, and mana field remains stable only when total feedback gain does not exceed unity.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
G = \alpha_{AB} \frac{\partial \langle A, M \rangle}{\partial t} \le 1
$$
where:
- $G$ — feedback gain of the ASM loop
- $\alpha_{AB}$ — AB coupling constant
- $\langle A, M \rangle$ — resonance overlap between the anima and mana fields
##### Description:
The Law of Soul Feedback Stability defines the upper bound for stable coupling between consciousness and the mana field. Within the closed feedback loop $A \rightleftharpoons{} S \rightleftharpoons{} M$, resonance amplification sustains coherent exchange between the soul and its Source. 

If feedback gain exceeds unity, the loop becomes overamplified, leading to resonance drift, Source strain, or catastrophic phase collapse. Conversely, maintaining subcritical gain preserves stable trans-phase coherence, enabling consistent mana flow and mental integrity.

This law establishes the quantitative stability limit for all soul–Source interactions, ensuring that conscious control remains within the Continuum’s harmonic threshold.
### III. Law of Coherence Evolution
##### Statement:
> In the absence of external disruption, coherent anima systems naturally evolve toward higher internal order through recursive resonance reinforcement, while remaining constrained by entropic consistency.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
\frac{d\kappa_A}{dt} \ge 0 \quad \text{while} \quad \frac{dS_\mathcal{C}}{dt} \ge 0
$$
where:
- $\kappa_A$ — coherence of the anima field 
- $S_\mathcal{C}$ — entropy through the Continuum
##### Description:
The Law of Coherence Evolution describes the self organizing tendency of conscious anima systems. Through recursive resonance, coherent souls reinforce their internal harmonic structure, gradually increasing informational order and stability. 

However, this progression operates within the universal constraint of entropic consistency.
Thus, the evolution of coherence represents the reorganization of entropy rather than a violation of it.
