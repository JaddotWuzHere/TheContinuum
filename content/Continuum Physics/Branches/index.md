title: Branches of Continuum Physics
---
## Overview
---
**[[Continuum Physics/index|Continuum physics]]**, as a unified framework, encompasses an expansive hierarchy of specialized disciplines. Each branch isolates and formalizes the behavior of a particular field, phase, or coupling within the Continuum while remaining bound by the **[[Continuum Physics/index#The Fundamental Laws of the Continuum|Fundamental Laws]]**.

These disciplines are not independent sciences but derivative expressions of the same coherent manifold, each a frame into the Continuum viewed through a distinct domain of manifestation.

While only a few branches have been formally codified, it is understood that the Continuum gives rise to a vast taxonomy of physical and metaphysical regimes yet unnamed. What follows are among the earliest and most developed fields of study.
## Branches

#### Manaphysics
**Focus:** Dynamics of the mana field and its trans-phase interaction with matter and consciousness. It attempts to describe the behavior of mana as both a physical and informational medium.

Manaphysics investigates the resonance structure of manaspace, governing how mana manifests, circulates, and exchanges energy across domains.

In practical terms, manaphysics underlies all known magical phenomena.

#### Anachysis
**Focus:** Coherence, identity, and the metaphysical mechanics of life. Anachysics studies the anima field and its coupling to mana through the Source, forming the theoretical basis of consciousness, will, and transcendence.

It defines how souls maintain continuity, evolve coherence, and interact with the Continuum through feedback and phase-lock stability.
