## Overview
---
Mana is a universal energetic substrate that exists throughout the **[[index#The Continuum|Continuum]]**, acting as an intermediary between realspace and manaspace. Mana does not obey conventional thermodynamic or electromagnetic laws. Rather, it follows field resonance dynamics that can interact with biological and material systems under certain conditions.

When dormant, mana exists in a latent phase, entirely decoupled from realspace matter and undetectable by physical means. When an organic or synthetic **[[Source|Source]]** opens a conduit, the field momentarily phases in, allowing manaspace energy to interact with realspace. 

Mana functions as a medium and currency of metaphysical work. It makes possible phenomena such as **[[Spellcasting|spellcasting]]** and **[[Mana Manipulation|mana manipulation]]**. Only entities of possession of a **[[Source|Source]]** may perform such actions.
## Physical Properties

#### The Mana Field
Mana exists as a continuous field denoted by 
$$M(x, t)=\{\rho_M, \boldsymbol{\Phi}_M\}$$
where:
- $\rho_M$ — mana density
- $\boldsymbol{\Phi}_M$ — mana flux.

Manaflows follow a gradient model, meaning high-density regions push flux toward lower-density regions, forming **[[Mana Currents|mana currents]]**. These currents are invisible in realspace. 

The mana field is not directly observable via electromagnetic or gravitational interaction, but it couples weakly to matter through what is known as the Arcane-Biological (AB) coupling constant, denoted $\alpha_{AB}$. This coupling allows Sources to store and channel mana internally, forming the basis for magic and various other metaphysical phenomena.

Mathematically, local mana density $\rho_M$ can be expressed as:
$$\rho_M=\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\textbf{M})$$
where:
- $\textbf{M}$ — spatial mana flux vector.
#### Phase Behavior
Mana exhibits varying phases of activity. Each phase represents distinct energetic regimes of the same underlying field, determined by its coherence, energy density, and coupling strength with realspace.
##### Fundamental Phases:
- ###### Latent Phase
	Mana in this phase exists as a quiescent background field. 
	- Field oscillations are weak and incoherent, producing negligible realspace influence
	- Constitutes the ambient mana permeating most environments
	- Within **[[Source]]**, latent mana serves as the reserve potential from which active use draws energy
	- Self-stabilizing; small disturbances naturally dissipate as the field relaxes back to equilibrium
- ###### Active Phase
	Mana enters this phase when mana becomes energetically excited.
	- Oscillations synchronize, forming structured currents or gradients capable of doing work
	- Interacts strongly with physical forces
	- Consumes mana potential, and prolonged activity depletes the field locally, forcing reversion to latent equilibrium
	- Meta-stabilizing; stable only while sustained by focus or energy input, returning to its latent phase otherwise
##### Phase Transitions
Phase transitions are continuous rather than abrupt.
A coherence threshold $C_{crit}$ separates quiescence from activation:
$$C>C_{crit}\implies \text{Active Phase}, C<C_{crit}\implies \text{Latent Phase}$$
This threshold varies across Sources and environments. Regions rich in ambient mana or with strong field feedback require less excitation to cross into the active regime, known as "mana sensitivity."
###### Critical Coherence State
At the threshold $C=C_{crit}$, the mana field enters a marginally stable regime.
- Excitation and dissipation are perfectly balanced
- Small perturbations can tip it toward activation or quiescence, making it highly sensitive to stimuli
- Transitional boundary, not a stable phase

After extended activation, the field often exhibits [[Branch - Manaphysics#4. Law of Phase Hysteresis|hysteresis]]. 
#### Flow and Circulation
Mana naturally moves both within and between Sources. Inside a Source, mana flows through internal channels that sustain a being's magical capacity.

Outside of individual Sources, mana also circulates throughout the environment in large-scale patterns, often forming ley currents or contributing to the atmospheric mana field. These flows connect all Sources indirectly, maintaining global equilibrium and influencing local mana density.

Though the exact mechanisms of these flows vary, all movement of mana follows the same fundamental principles of energy balance and field continuity.

#### Mana-Matter Interaction
Mana interacts with matter not through direct mechanical force, but through resonance and field coupling. Its influence depends on the structural harmonics and energetic configuration of the material it encounters. When a material’s intrinsic frequency aligns with local manaspace harmonics, energy transfer becomes efficient, allowing mana to flow through or bind to that substance.

Such materials are termed mana-conductive media. They facilitate stable field propagation, serving as conduits or amplifiers for magical constructs. In contrast, mana-inert media possess dissonant lattice structures that scatter or absorb mana flux, creating turbulence and dissipation in the surrounding field. This dichotomy explains why certain substances are favored in metaphysical activity.

In biological systems, mana coupling occurs through the Arcane–Biological (AB) interface, governed by the constant $\alpha_{AB}$. This interaction allows organisms possessing a Source to store, regulate, and channel mana internally. The efficiency of this coupling determines both the individual’s magical capacity and the rate of mana regeneration following depletion.

At larger scales, mana–matter interactions give rise to various ambient field effects. These phenomena arise naturally from the same principles that govern field continuity and trans-phase resonance.
