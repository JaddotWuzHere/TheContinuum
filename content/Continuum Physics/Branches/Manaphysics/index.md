title: Manaphysics
---
## Overview
---
Manaphysics is the formal study of the behaviors, interactions, and governing principles of **[[Mana|mana]]** within the **[[Continuum Physics#The Continuum|Continuum]]**. It focuses on how the mana field manifests, evolves, and couples with other domains under the universal constraints established by **[[Continuum Physics|Continuum physics]]**.

While Continuum physics define the invariant laws that apply to all domains, manaphysics specializes in the unique dynamics of the mana field, namely its phase behavior, resonance properties, and trans-phase coupling with matter and consciousness.

The Laws of Manaphysics describe how the universal invariants of the Continuum manifest within the mana field. They govern the flow, transformation, and resonance of mana across realspace and manaspace, defining the principles under which all manaphysical phenomena occur. While the Fundamental Laws of the Continuum establish the universal constraints of conservation, symmetry, and causality, the Laws of Manaphysics express these principles as they specifically apply to the dynamics of mana and its interaction with matter and consciousness.
## The Laws of Manaphysics
---
### I. Law of Resonant Correspondence
##### Statement:
> Every structure or configuration in realspace possesses a harmonic counterpart in manaspace; interactions occur when their resonant frequencies align.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
R_R(\omega)\leftrightarrow R_M(\omega)\quad \text{if} \quad \mid \omega_R-\omega_M \mid \leq \epsilon
$$
where:
- $R_R(\omega)$ — resonant response in realspace
- $R_M(\omega)$ — resonant response in manaspace
- $\epsilon$ — allowable frequency deviation for stable coupling
##### Description:
The Law of Resonant Correspondence describes why certain materials, symbols, or entities "resonate" more strongly with mana than others. When realspace and manaspace harmonics fall within the resonance window $\epsilon$, energy coupling becomes efficient, enabling spell amplification, enchantment, and Source attunement. 

Misaligned resonance leads to dissipation or destructive interference, limiting the reach or stability of magical effects. In essence, coherence dictates potency.
### II. Law of Phase Equilibrium
##### Statement: 
> The total energy exchange between realspace and manaspace seeks dynamic equilibrium. Any imbalance produces compensatory flux until a stable energetic ratio is restored.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(E_R - \kappa E_M\right) = 0
$$
where:
- $E_R$ — energy in realspace
- $E_M$ — energy in manaspace
- $\kappa$ — equilibrium constant of coupling
##### Description:
The Law of Phase Equilibrium governs the self-regulating dynamics of mana across domains. Excessive mana influx drives dissipation into realspace or turbulence within manaspace, while depletion draws latent energy across the phase boundary to restore balance.

This compensatory behavior maintains large-scale energetic stability throughout the Continuum, giving rise to phenomena such as natural mana circulation, leyline flow, and the steady regeneration of ambient fields.
## III. Law of Flux Resonance
##### Statement:
> Mana currents amplify when multiple field oscillations achieve coherent phase synchronization, producing resonance feedback across the Continuum.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
A_{\text{net}} = \left| \sum_{i} A_i e^{i \phi_i} \right|
$$
where:
- $A_i$ — amplitude of the $i$-th field oscillation
- $\phi_i$ — phase of each oscillation
- $\Delta \phi$ — relative phase difference between interacting fields
- $A_{net}$ — resultant amplitude after superposition
##### Description:
The Law of Flux Resonance governs constructive interference and amplification within mana fields. When oscillating field components align in phase, their amplitudes combine coherently, producing exponential feedback that reinforces flux intensity.

However, when resonance exceeds local stability thresholds, feedback collapses coherence. This law defines the upper operational limits of stable amplification, establishing the boundary between controlled enhancement and runaway energetic instability.
## IV. Law of Phase Hysteresis
##### Statement:
> After excitation, mana fields retain residual coherence from prior states, delaying full relaxation to equilibrium. This persistence of phase alignment manifests as temporal lag in field recovery.
##### Formal Expression:
$$
\Phi(t) = \Phi_0 + (\Phi_i - \Phi_0)e^{-t / \tau}
$$
where:
- $\Phi$ — instantaneous field coherence
- $\Phi_0$ — equilibrium (rest) coherence
- $\tau$ — relaxation time constant of the field
##### Description:
The Law of Phase Hysteresis describes the memory effect inherent to mana fields. After deactivation, residual coherence lingers before dissipating completely. This accounts for the persistence of enchantment traces, slow mana recovery, and afterglow effects in spellcasting phenomena.

The law reflects the finite temporal inertia of the mana field. Coherence cannot vanish instantaneously once disturbed. In essence, mana remembers its excitation, and equilibrium is restored only as coherence decays through entropic relaxation.
