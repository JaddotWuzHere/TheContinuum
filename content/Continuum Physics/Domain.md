## Overview
---
A domain is a self consistent field system within the **[[Continuum Physics/index#The Continuum|Continuum]]**. Each one represents a distinct manifestation of energy, geometry, and information. Every domain follows local constants and coupling behaviors unique to its regime, but all remain bound by the same fundamental laws that preserve coherence across existence, as formulated in the **[[Continuum Physics/index#II. Law of Continuum Symmetry|Law of Continuum Symmetry]]**.

Domains aren’t separate worlds or alternate dimensions; rather, they’re coherent phases of the same underlying substrate, or separate layers of existence within the same reality. Each exists as a stable configuration of field behavior, interacting with others through trans-phase coupling and energy exchange. In conjunction, they form the Continuum as a whole.
## Domain Classifications 
---
Domains within the Continuum can be organized into four primary classifications, each defined by its stability, behavior, and relationship to the Fundamental Laws.

While every domain arises from the same unified Continuum substrate, their categorical properties determine how they manifest, persist, and interact with other layers of existence.
### Fundamental Domains
Fundamental domains form the structural and conceptual foundation of the Continuum.
They are permanent, universal fields that define the essential aspects of reality, such as matter, energy, consciousness, space, and time.

Each fundamental domain possesses its own internal constants and conservation laws, yet all remain bound by the universal invariants of Continuum physics. They do not emerge or vanish; they are. The interaction of fundamental domains gives rise to all other phenomena.

###### Realspace
The familiar and observable layer of existence. Realspace defines the baseline energetic regime where classical physics holds true. It provides the reference frame for matter, inertia, and measurable cause and effect. Though it appears isolated, realspace continuously exchanges energy and information with adjacent domains through coupling phenomena that remain invisible to ordinary observation.
###### Manaspace
An energetic domain that governs the flow and resonance of mana. Unlike realspace, manaspace operates under field-resonance dynamics rather than thermodynamic law. It serves as the substrate for metaphysical energy and arcane interaction. When accessed through a Source, its currents can influence realspace directly, allowing for controlled energy transfer, spellcasting, and field manipulation. Manaspace is the foundation of **[[Continuum Physics/Branches/Manaphysics/index|manaphysics]]**.
###### Animaspace
The informational and cognitive domain where consciousness originates. It contains the anima field, which is the structure of awareness, memory, and individuality. Animaspace anchors selfhood and allows identity to persist through transformation and death. Its interaction with manaspace through the Source gives rise to life, thought, and will. The study of this coupling forms the basis of **[[Continuum Physics/Branches/Anachysics/index|anachysics]]**.
### Transient Domains
Transient domains are conditional realities, existing only when the Continuum’s parameters align within a specific range. They are internally stable and law-abiding, but only manifest under fixed physical or metaphysical conditions. When those conditions lapse, the domain ceases to exist entirely, leaving behind only a faint resonance where it once stood.

Each transient domain is predictable in behavior but impermanent in form. They may serve as bridges, stabilizers, or reactive systems that appear only when necessary. Performing an act that depends on a transient domain succeeds or fails entirely on whether that domain currently exists.

### Phantom Domains
Phantom domains are energetically null reflections, stable illusions generated by the Continuum’s own resonance. They appear real, behave coherently, and may even be perceived or measured, yet their net energy is always zero. Everything that occurs within a phantom domain perfectly cancels itself out.

Their purpose is interpretive rather than physical. They give appearance, image, and perception to existence. Phantom domains create the illusion of solidity and continuity, allowing reality to be perceived, whether correctly or otherwise.

### Aberrant Domains
Aberrant domains are law-consistent anomalies. They are domains that obey the Fundamental Laws perfectly, yet produce pathological or destabilizing effects when interacting with the rest of the Continuum. They do not violate physics; they simply realize it in extreme or unintended forms.

Inside an aberrant domain, the equations close correctly, but the results are catastrophic to ordinary stability. Effects include but are not limited to time inversion, scale collapse, matter generation from negative curvature, or chaos and order sustenance.

To the Continuum, they are not errors but proofs that even the impossible remains lawful.
