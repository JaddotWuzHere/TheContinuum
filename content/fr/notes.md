Book

Survivor

Field Report / Expedition Log
A scientific account written during a major experiment, survey, or crisis.

> _Excerpt from Expedition Log 07-B, recorded moments before gravitational synchronization failure._  
> Adds realism and tragedy — the voice of someone witnessing the law manifest firsthand.

Inscription / Monument Text
Something engraved on a memorial, ruin, or temple — formal, reverent, and cryptic.

> _Carved upon the Pillar of Equilibrium, erected at the site of the Dimensional Collapse._  
> Gives the quote mythic longevity, as if civilization tried to immortalize a warning.

Personal Journal / Research Notes
A scholar or observer reflecting after the event, mixing rational thought with quiet awe.

> _From the private notebooks of Dr. C. Valen, two days before his disappearance._  
> Humanizes the discovery — intimate but intellectual.

Religious Scripture / Esoteric Fragment
Written in the style of revelation or prophecy — poetic and sacred.

> _From the Codex of Refractions, Verse VII._  
> Turns the law into something worshipped or feared.

Observatory Transmission / Data Fragment
Part of a corrupted recording or automated log — sterile but chilling.

> _Recovered transmission fragment, Observatory Node Θ-9: “...structural correspondence detected… reciprocal curvature unstable…”_  
> Adds a sci-fi undertone — haunting through understatement.

Testimony Before a Tribunal
Someone defending or confessing their role in an experiment gone wrong.

> _Excerpt from the Testimony of Alaric Deyn, Inquiry into the Continuum Strain Incident._  
> Adds gravity and formality — bureaucratic aftermath of catastrophe.
