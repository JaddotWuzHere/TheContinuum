## Overview
---
A Source is a trans-phase coupling field that enables a conscious being to interact with **[[en/Continuum Physics/Branches/Manaphysics/Mana|mana]]**. It forms naturally whenever a coherent region of the anima field achieves stable resonance with the surrounding mana field. Through this resonance, intent and awareness can be translated into directed mana flow.

While it isn't clear which types of entities are guaranteed to possess natural Sources, it has been found that most, if not all, conscious beings are born innately with a Source. The strength, stability, and efficiency of said Source vary according to the coherence of the soul and the local mana environment. While the **[[Souls|soul]]** provides individuality and will, the Source provides access and control. 
## Physical Properties
---
#### Field Structure
A Source is not a physical organ but a localized resonance pattern sustained at the boundary between the anima and mana fields. It represents a region of phase lock, where no oscillations of both fields synchronize in frequency and phase. 

This coupling converts the abstract modulation of consciousness into measurable energy exchange. Mathematically, the Source can be expressed as:
$$
S(x,t) = f(A(x,t), M(x,t)), \qquad \frac{dE_R}{dt} = -\frac{dE_M}{dt} = \alpha_{AB} \langle A, M \rangle
$$
where:
- $A$ — anima field
- $M$ — local mana field
- $\alpha_{AB}$ — AB coupling constant
- $\langle A, M \rangle$ — resonance overlap.

Thus, the Source acts as a bi-metaphysical transducer. It receives modulations of thought from the soul and re-emits them as mana flow, while stabilizing feedback from the mana field back into the body.
#### Formation and Resonance
A natural Source forms spontaneously when a developing region in the anima field attains sufficient self coherence and self awareness to sustain continuous resonance with ambient mana. Once the soul's harmonic pattern stabilizes, the Source emerges at the interface between the two fields, settling into that identity permanently. This process cannot be artificially induced or replicated. Each Source is unique and exclusively bound to its parent soul due to its harmonic signature. Thus, no two Sources are identical, and none can be transferred between individuals.

While the natural Source is metaphysical, its resonance aligns closely with biological processes. In most species, the field intensity peaks near the nervous and circulatory systems, reflecting the rhythmic activity that supports mana flow through the body.
#### Soul-Source Coupling
The soul serves as an anchor point for natural Sources. The Source attaches to the soul's coherent structure through phase lock. As long as the soul maintains coherence, the Source mirrors its signature automatically. If the soul destabilizes or departs the body, the phase lock collapses and the Source ceases to exist. Beyond this stage, no method to preserve the Source is known.

*(For more detail, see: **[[zh/Continuum Physics/Branches/Anachysics/Soul#Soul-Source Coupling|Soul-Source Coupling]]**)*
#### Interaction with Mana
The Source mediates energy exchange and information transfer between the soul and the mana field. It does not produce mana but draws upon and shapes existing flux within the **[[The Continuum|Continuum]]**. 

When activated through will or focus, the natural Source aligns the soul’s internal pattern with specific harmonics in the mana field. This process transfers energy across the Continuum boundary while conserving total system energy, as described by the **[[en/Continuum Physics/index#1. Law of Continuum Conservation|Law of Continuum Conservation]]**. 

Efficiency varies between individuals and depends on:
- **Coupling Strength ($\alpha_{AB}$):** the Arcane-Biological constant, reflecting how well the natural Source integrates with living matter
- **Soul Coherence:** the stability and clarity of the soul's field structure
- **Environmental Mana Density:** external field stability and available energy
#### Characteristics and Behavior
Natural Sources exhibit various inherent characteristics:
- **Uniqueness:** Each Source mirrors the harmonic signature of its soul
- **Throughput:** Determines the maximum mana flux transferable at once
- **Stability:** Resistance to feedback collapse under sustained flow
- **Detectability:** Emits oscillations perceptible through manapulse
- **Adaptability:** Improves with focus and resonance discipline
- **Mortality:** Collapses irreversibly upon **[[Death|death]]** when phase lock breaks

Long term refinement of a Source is possible through training and resonance calibration, but reckless or unbalanced mana use can lead to permanent degradation.
#### Damage and Collapse
Minor damage to a Source reduces coupling efficiency, which may cause fatigue, weakened mana throughput, or instability. Major disruption may result in field misalignment and dangerous feedback, wherein excessive resonance amplification collapses coherence and destabilizes the Source. *(See: **[[en/Continuum Physics/Branches/Manaphysics/index#3. Law of Flux Resonance|Law of Flux Resonance]]**)*

A collapsed Source loses coherence entirely. The soul may remain intact but becomes mana inert, unable to interact with the mana field, a condition known as **[[Anima-Source Disjunction (ASD)|anima-source disjunction (ASD)]]**. 

Collapsed Sources cannot regenerate. Artificial re-linking through synthetic anchoring is possible, however.

## Postmortem State
---
When a living being dies, biological rhythm and anima coherence both collapse, breaking the phase lock that sustains the Source. The Source disintegrates instantaneously, leaving behind only a residual trace or “signature echo” in the surrounding mana. This echo may persist briefly as a detectable imprint but lacks structure and cannot be reactivated.

Reanimation without a Source results in mana inert consciousness, known as **[[Undead|undead]]**. Various other forms of reanimation past death exist; in all cases, the original Source is irretrievably lost. *(See: **[[Necromancy]]**)*
## Detection and Manapulse
---
Every Source constantly emits faint field oscillations corresponding to its resonance state. Beings with Sources can perceive these oscillations through manapulse. 

Stronger Sources generate clearer signals detectable over greater distances, while weaker or suppressed Sources emit minimal flux and are harder to sense. Skilled practitioners, however, can hide their resonance and mask their presence from detection, a technique known as **[[Veiling]]**, although complete concealment is rare. Environmental conditions, such as ley density and interference, can also affect perception clarity. 

*(For more detail, see: **[[Manapulse]]**)*
## Synthetic Sources
---
While natural Sources form through the anima-mana interface, synthetic Sources are artificially engineered trans-phase conduits that mimic this behavior without requiring a soul anchor. 

They function as mana-field converters, using engineered resonance patterns to open controlled phase channels between manaspace and realspace. Unlike their natural counterparts, synthetic Sources lack any link to the anima field and require continuous stabilization energy to remain alive. 
#### Composition and Principle
Synthetic Sources replace Arcane-Biological (AB) coupling with a technological resonance core, governed by the synthetic coupling constant $\alpha_{SYN}$, which measures the efficiency of artificial trans-phase conduction. 

In most systems, $\alpha_{SYN}<\alpha_{AB}$, meaning synthetic devices are inherently less efficient and prone to instability under sustained use. 
#### Characteristics
- Operates through engineered feedback loops instead of self-reinforcing coherence
- Identical patterns can be reproduced, allowing standardization across devices
- Loss of energy input results in immediate phase collapse
- Emits uniform, mechanical signatures distinguishable from organic resonance through manapulse sensing
- Field drift and harmonic interference can destabilize surrounding mana environments, making large scale synthetic Source deployment heavily regulated
#### Applications
Synthetic Sources serve as the foundation of **[[Magitechnology|magitechnology]]**, enabling mana-powered machinery and constructs. *(See: **[[Metaphysical Engineering]]**)*

When coupled to computing systems or **[[Manalgorithms|manalgorithms]]**, they can emulate the behavior of natural casters but lack adaptive self awareness. *(See: **[[Mana Programming]]**)*

In rare cases, preserved souls or anima fragments have been bound to synthetic Sources, creating hybrid entities that regain consciousness and limited magical capability. Such fusions are unstable and ethically controversial, as the artificial resonance cannot perfectly replicate natural phase lock. *(See: **[[Biomancy]]**)*

## Cultural and Biological Significance
---
Sources represent both biological adaptation and metaphysical identity. Their strengths often correlate with vitality and spiritual capacity. Cultures across the Continuum recognize the Source as the "XXXX," though interpretations vary. 

Magical education and discipline focus heavily on Source refinement. Conversely, tampering with another's Source is among the gravest **[[Metaphysical Taboos|taboos]]**, often regarded as metaphysical assault.
