## Date system
---
$\Sigma$ -> 588 Earth days ("year") - **Periodon**
$\Phi$ -> 4 Earth days ("day") - **Opera**
$\Theta$ -> Changes +/- every 21$\Phi$ ("season") - **Temper** (+/-), **Repertory**

In essence, there are 147$\Phi$ (588 days) in 1$\Sigma$ (1 year), and the "season" changes every 21$\Phi$ (84 days) for a total of 7 "seasons"

$\Xi$ -> Error measurement (time dilation) - **Drift**

Each opera is divided into 4 "quarters" (1 Earth day) $\Phi^\varphi$ - **Movement**
$\varphi = 1$: Prelude
$\varphi = 2$: Aria
$\varphi = 3$: Interlude
$\varphi = 4$: Reverie

Notation:
Scientific - $\Sigma 342 :\Theta0.010^+:\Phi 83.2:\Xi1.00000$
Formal - $\Sigma342 : \Theta^+ : \Phi83^2:\Xi^+_0$
Common - $\Sigma342:\Phi83^2$

## Time Measurement
---
The seven repertories are as named as follows:
I - Apertura (+) | Clausura (-)
II - Radiance (+) | Eclipse (-)
III - Vivace (+) | Lento (-)
IV - Anthem (+) | Elegy (-)
V - Resonata (+) | Dissonata (-)
VI - Reprise (+) | Diminution (-)
VII - Finale (+) | Overture (-)

Each repertory has a "equinox":
- During repertory transition, when derivative is 0 - Intermission
- During middle of repertory, when derivative is max - Crescendo

During crescendos, magic is the most unstable due to extreme time changes (harder to control)
During intermissions, magic is the most stable and predictable (easier to control)
## Epigraph stylizing

**College Lecture / Academic Transcript**
A formal exposition delivered to students or colleagues — detached, yet illuminating.
> _Lecture 23: “Theoretical Failures of Mana Containment,” Professor Elara Korr, Department of Trans-Physical Studies, CMU-Continuum Campus._

Lends authenticity and realism — turns abstract lore into institutionalized science.

**Book Excerpt / Historical Account**
An excerpt from a published volume, blending scholarly tone with hindsight.
> _From _The Rise and Collapse of the First Resonant Empire_, Vol. II, by T. A. Soren._

Adds perspective — the sense of history interpreting myth.

**Survivor Testimony / Oral Account**
A firsthand recollection of catastrophe — emotional, fragmented, human.
> _Recorded interview with survivor 118-A: “The light bent inward, and then... nothing was real anymore.”_

Infuses the narrative with empathy and vulnerability — brings scale down to the personal.

**Field Report / Expedition Log**
A scientific account written during a major experiment, survey, or crisis.
> _Excerpt from Expedition Log 07-B, recorded moments before gravitational synchronization failure._  

Adds realism and tragedy — the voice of someone witnessing the law manifest firsthand.

**Inscription / Monument Text**
Something engraved on a memorial, ruin, or temple — formal, reverent, and cryptic.
> _Carved upon the Pillar of Equilibrium, erected at the site of the Dimensional Collapse._  

Gives the quote mythic longevity, as if civilization tried to immortalize a warning.

**Personal Journal / Research Notes**
A scholar or observer reflecting after the event, mixing rational thought with quiet awe.
> _From the private notebooks of Dr. C. Valen, two days before his disappearance._  

Humanizes the discovery — intimate but intellectual.

**Religious Scripture / Esoteric Fragment**
Written in the style of revelation or prophecy — poetic and sacred.
> _From the Codex of Refractions, Verse VII._  

Turns the law into something worshipped or feared.

**Observatory Transmission / Data Fragment**
Part of a corrupted recording or automated log — sterile but chilling.
> _Recovered transmission fragment, Observatory Node Θ-9: “...structural correspondence detected… reciprocal curvature unstable…”_  

Adds a sci-fi undertone — haunting through understatement.

**Testimony Before a Tribunal**
Someone defending or confessing their role in an experiment gone wrong.
> _Excerpt from the Testimony of Alaric Deyn, Inquiry into the Continuum Strain Incident._  

Adds gravity and formality — bureaucratic aftermath of catastrophe.

**Classified Report / Government Dossier**
Dry, official documentation masking horror under protocol.
> _Declassified memorandum, Continuum Security Bureau, Case 1041-Φ._

Evokes secrecy and control — the machinery of authority coping with the unknown.

**Theorem / Philosophical Treatise**
Analytical, formal, detached — turns belief into law.
> _From _On the Ontology of Realspace Fields_, Section III: “All flux is self-referential, and thus all reality recursive.”_

Adds intellectual gravity — as if the laws themselves were once debated.

**Folklore / Oral Tradition**
A myth retold through generations — distorted but resonant.
> _Old miner’s tale, circulated in the ruins of the Ninth Vault._

Suggests cultural memory — the transformation of science into superstition.

**Abandoned Note / Scene Fragment**
A torn or half-burned page discovered at a research site or residence.
> _Recovered from the ruins of Laboratory Sector 3 — “It wasn’t the light that killed them. It was the sound it made.”_

Adds immediacy and dread — personal collapse frozen mid-sentence.

**Incident Report / Forensic Brief**
A terse document summarizing catastrophic aftermath with sterile precision.
> _Continuum Safety Division, Incident 421-A: “Subject matter dispersed beyond measurable boundaries. Containment deemed infeasible.”_

Juxtaposes bureaucratic detachment against cosmic horror — the system processing the unprocessable.

**Police Transcript / Crime Scene Evidence**
Fragments of dialogue or recovered recordings from an investigation.
> _Audio Transcript 09-14-R: “Don’t go near the mirror. It’s... it’s breathing.”_

Grounds the supernatural in procedural realism — horror through routine.
