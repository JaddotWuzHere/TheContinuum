## Overview
---
The Chronomatic Concordance, also known as the STPX Calendar, is the official temporal system used across the entirety of **[[Thalen]]**. It represents one of the most enduring legacies of the **[[The Concordant Reform|Concordant Reform]]**, the intellectual unification of Thalen’s many civilizations under a single measure of time based on observable physical resonance.

Where once each kingdom measured its years by its own metrics, the **[[Concordance]]** replaced all existing time-systems with a unifying framework across all of Thalen. It stands as an accord among all societies—including scholars, merchants, and rulers alike—that time itself must be standardized if civilization was to endure.

The Chronomatic Concordance thus became the cornerstone of Thalenic order. 
## Structure of Time

|  Symbol  | Term | Definition                                                                                 |
| :------ | :---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\Sigma$ |  Periodon  | The grand cycle of history and record, derived from Thalen’s natural resonant oscillation. |
| $\Theta$ | Repertoire | One-seventh of a periodon; the tonal and climatic phase within the greater cycle.          |
|  $\Phi$  |   Opera    | The principal beat of civil life, divided internally into four movements.                  |
|  $\Xi$   |   Drift    | The deviation of a local clock or region from the Horaxian Standard                        |

Each periodon ($\Sigma$) comprises of seven repertoires ($\Theta$), and each repertoire contains twenty-one operas ($\Phi$). 

The Thalenic calendar therefore follows a rhythmic structure of 7 : 21 : 4, chosen for both its mathematical stability and its symbolic association with balance and continuity.
## Physical Basis
---
Unlike ancient calendars based on celestial observation, the periodon is defined by a measurable terrestrial phenomenon known as the XXXX, a periodic fluctuation in the geomagnetic and mana-luminal fields.

These oscillations were first detected in early manometric observatories, which noted that the flux amplitude rose and fell with incredible consistency, forming a full cycle approximately every 147 operas. The discovery of this pattern provided a natural basis for time measurement, without the ambiguity of astronomical irregularities.

Scholars of the XXXX later formalized this discovery into the STPX system, defining the periodon ($\Sigma$) as one complete oscillation of the planetary flux resonance. Because this oscillation correlates with both mana stability and climatic regularity, it became the perfect foundation for a calendar.

## Notation Systems
---
Thalenic chronometry employs three registers of notation across disciplines:
#### Scientific Notation
Used in measurement and navigation:
$$
\Sigma p : \Theta r^{\pm}_\theta:\Phi o.\varphi : \Xi d
$$
#### Formal Notation
Used in civic records and official documentation:
$$
\Sigma p:\Theta^\pm_r: \Phi o^\varphi : \Xi^\pm_n
$$
#### Commonhand Notation
Used in everyday situations:
$$
\Sigma p : \Theta r:\Phi o^\varphi
$$
where:
- $p$ — current periodon
- $r$ — current repertoire
- $\theta$ — current temporal phase
- $o$ — current opera
- $\varphi$ — current movement
- $d$ — measured drift
- $n$ — absolute value of drift score.

The exponent of $\Theta$ denotes bias of temper, while the exponent of $\Xi$ denotes bias of drift.

These forms vary slightly between disciplines but retain uniform hierarchy and ratio throughout Thalenic recordkeeping.
## Movements
---
Thalenic society divides each opera into four movements ($\varphi$). 
#### The Four Movements of an Opera
- Prelude
- Aria
- Interlude
- Reverie

Movements are not treated as separate temporal units, but as indices within an Opera, used for greater granularity in scheduling and instrumentation.
## Temper and Repertoires
---
Within each periodon, time does not pass uniformly. Its flow subtly accelerates and decelerates according to a harmonic oscillation known as the temporal wave, a fundamental rhythm of causality measurable through chronometric instrumentation.

The instantaneous direction of this acceleration defines the temper of that moment. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
$$
\text{temper} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\text{sin}(\theta)
$$
where:
- $\theta$ — current temporal phase

A periodon contains seven repertoires, each representing one half-wave of this oscillation. Thus, time alternates between acceleration and deceleration seven times within the course of a single periodon.

Importantly, the bias parity alternates between successive periodons. If one periodon begins in a positive phase ($\Theta^+$), the next begins in a negative phase ($\Theta^-$), maintaining overall symmetry across the larger continuum of time. Over two consecutive periodons, the temporal wave completes one full sinusoidal period.
$$
\Sigma_1 = (+, -, +, -, +, -, +), \quad \Sigma_{n+1} = -\Sigma_n, \quad n\in\mathbb{N}^+
$$

These alternating periodons ensure that the long-term average of temporal acceleration across Thalen remains zero, preserving stability while allowing cyclical variation in how time is experienced and measured.
#### The Seven Repertoires
Each repertoire corresponds to a distinct harmonic of the temporal wave. Thalenic scholars classify and name them according to their temporal character and bias, each possessing a positive and negative form depending on parity:

| No. | Positive Bias ($\Theta^+$) | Negative Bias ($\Theta^-$) |
|:--- |:-------------------------- |:-------------------------- |
| I   | **Apertura**               | **Clausura**               |
| II  | **Radiance**               | **Eclipse**                |
| III | **Vivace**                 | **Lento**                  |
| IV  | **Anthem**                 | **Elegy**                  |
| V   | **Resonata**               | **Dissonata**              |
| VI  | **Reprise**                | **Diminuition**            |
| VII | **Finale**                 | **Overture**               |

Each repertoire defines a characteristic bias curve of time’s acceleration within the periodon. As the wave rises and falls, the flow of causality subtly quickens or slows, affecting processes that rely on temporal consistency.
#### Intermissions and Crescendos
At the transition between two repertoires, where the temporal wave crosses equilibrium and the temper momentarily reaches 0, the system enters an intermission.

During an intermission, the flow of time is perfectly balanced, neither accelerating nor decelerating, and all chronometric instruments synchronize most readily with the Horaxian Standard.

Conversely, at the midpoint of each repertoire, where the temper reaches its greatest magnitude, the system enters a crescendo.

Here, the rate of temporal change is at its extreme, producing measurable effects in mana flow and field coherence. Many magical or mechanical systems experience heightened volatility during these intervals, and most Concordant institutions schedule calibrations to avoid them.

*(For more detail, see: **[[Astrology]]**)*
## Drift and Synchronization
---
All clocks and field instruments across Thalen are synchronized to the Grand Horaxian Clock maintained at the capital of XXXX. However, over time, mechanical, environmental, or magical interference introduces small deviations known as drift ($\Xi$).

To preserve unity, the Process of XXXX is conducted at the beginning of every repertoire.
This recalibration brings every civic timepiece into harmony with the Horaxian Standard, restoring what is called Concordant Flow.
#### Measurement of Drift
Drift is defined as a scalar ratio between a local time standard and the Grand XXXX Standard. Its drift score is calculated using the following function:
$$
\text{score}(x)=\lfloor\text{raw}(x)\rfloor, \qquad \text{raw}(x) = \operatorname{sgn}(x - 1) \, A \left( e^{\frac{B}{d}} - 1 \right)
$$
where:
- $x$ — measured drift, $\in (-1, 1)$
- $A$ — $0.0030$
- $B$ — $6.5$
- $d$ — $\text{min}(x+1, -x+1)$.

A drift score of 2 can be interpreted as negligible, while a drift score of 30 can be noticeable; a drift score higher than 100 can prove to be disastrous. 

Within Thalenic idiom, “to fall from Concordance” describes both temporal and moral deviation.
## The Concordant Reform
---
The Concordant Reform ($\Sigma 0001$) unified Thalen’s calendars after centuries of inconsistency.
Delegates of the XXXX Council met in XXXX to establish a single rhythm based on measurable periodic flux rather than celestial motion. The signing of the **[[Concord of Horaxis]]** marked the start of a new era known as the First Concordant Periodon from which all current dating proceeds.
