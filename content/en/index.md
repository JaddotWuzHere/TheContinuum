## Preface
---
This is no fantasy. 

This is a universe that needs no gods to govern its laws, as the same familiar principles of matter, motion, and energy persist.

But alongside those principles exists another fundamental property of reality—mana.

Here, magic is not myth nor miracle, but an additional layer of physics integrated into the same natural order. Its discovery reshaped every science and every civilization that followed. Every species that learned to wield it became stronger; those that did not perished. 

Born from magic's relentless demand of intellect, this is a universe ruled by scholarship, one where knowledge itself determines survival.

**Welcome to the Continuum.** 
## Fields of Study
---
The Continuum is vast, but its laws are consistent. Every discipline, from metaphysics to biology, stems from the same foundation: the study of how reality maintains coherence between the physical and the magical.

Scholars divide this knowledge into broad fields, each dedicated to understanding a different aspect of existence.

The foundational science of the universe.
###### [[Thaumatopathology]]
The medical science of magic-related disorders.
## Universe Compendium

Beyond its sciences, the Continuum is shaped by the civilizations, histories, and philosophies that grew from its pursuit of knowledge. These entries record the living world, such as the people, institutions, and ideas that define how the universe understands itself.
