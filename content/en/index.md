## Introduction
---
This is not Earth, nor is it a distant future of it. In fact, Earth doesn't exist at all. Yet the same familiar laws of matter, motion, and energy still hold true. 

But alongside them exists another fundamental property of reality—mana.

Here, magic is not myth or miracle, but an additional layer of physics woven into the same natural order. Its discovery reshaped every science, every species, and every civilization that followed. Every species that learned to wield it developed; those that did not disappeared. 

The result is a universe deeply academic in nature, one where progress depends on comprehension, and knowledge itself determines survival.

Welcome to the Continuum. 
## Fields of Study
---
The Continuum is vast, but its laws are consistent. Every discipline, from metaphysics to biology, stems from the same foundation: the study of how reality maintains coherence between the physical and the magical.

Scholars divide this knowledge into broad fields, each dedicated to understanding a different aspect of existence.

The foundational science of the universe.

**[[Thaumatopathology]]:**
The medical science of magic-related disorders.
## Universe Compendia

Beyond its sciences, the Continuum is shaped by the civilizations, histories, and philosophies that grew from its pursuit of knowledge. These entries record the living world: he people, institutions, and ideas that define how the universe understands itself.
